        \nThis can\'t be undone and food can\'t be uneaten!</string>

    <string name="dialog_about_body">I love food and I love eating new things in new places. I
        still can\'t believe my luck that I spent the better part of three years living in the
        wonderful city of New Orleans, sleeping on an air mattress so I could spend all of my money
        eating interesting meals like
        gas station boudin or Commander\'s Palace turtle soup.
        \n
        \nUnfortunately, as a side effect of this lifespan-shortening life style (and possibly
        from IPAs, sazeracs, and red wine) I found that I was having a tough time keeping it all
        straight. After a point, you can\'t remember what was when and where with
        who. Since eating good food in the company of good people is one of life\'s great joys,
        forgetting these meals is a true sin to me.
        \n
        \nI made a few valiant efforts at carrying a notebook, but I was always caught without it.
        I tried general note taking apps, but it is slow, cumbersome, and clunky. I took photos
        that just got buried in my gallery, never to be seen again. Since I no longer have the
        distraction of New Orleans food and nightlife (and I might be mildly obsessive when a
        project is in mind), this is my attempt at a better way of remembering meals.
        \n
        \nI am not a programmer by education or occupation, so I have been learning along the way.
        You might find a few bugs and glitches here and there. Please, let me know and I\'ll do my
        best to correct them. Along the way, I will be updating and improving the user interface
        to make it as efficient as possible. And hopefully prettier, too.
        \n
        \nNow that I have the tool I wanted, I no longer live in New Orleans and I try to
        spend money on things other than restaurants, like new clothes and actual furniture.
        Even though I may be missing a few meals from my journal, I hope it\'s something you find
        useful.
        \n
        \nPlease let me know your thoughts, questions, comments, or complaints.

        \nNOTE: Memory Bite currently stores meals locally on your phone and references your saved
        photos. I am working on providing cloud backup service for your journals, but for the
        moment your meal journal is saved only on the phone your app is on. Your journal will be
        saved when updating to newer versions of Memory Bite, but it will not carry over to new
        phones or devices. Stay tuned for updates!

    <string name="dialog_help_header">What is Memory Bite?</string>
    <string name="dialog_help_body">Memory Bite is a quick, lightweight food journal which tracks
        photos and notes of different meals and lets you quickly flip through your previous meals.
        You can even share with friends and family. It is intended to be fast and unobtrusive so
        that you can make entries without interrupting your meal.
        \n
