    <string name="dialog_about_body">I love food and I love eating new things in new places. I
        still can\'t believe my luck that I spent the better part of three years living in the
        wonderful city of New Orleans, sleeping on an air mattress so I could spend all of my money
        eating interesting meals like
        gas station boudin or Commander\'s Palace turtle soup.
        \n
        \nUnfortunately, as a side effect of this life-span shortening life style (and possibly
        from IPAs, sazeracs, and red wine) I found that I was having a tough time keeping it all
        straight. After a point, there\'s just no way you can remember what was when and where with
        who. Since I think that eating good food, especially in the company of good people, is one
        of the greatest gifts you can ask for in life, forgetting these meals is a true sin to me.
        \n
        \nI made a few valiant efforts at carrying a notebook, but I was always caught without it.
        I tried tracking meals and photos in apps meant for general note taking, but it is slow,
        cumbersome, and clunky. I wanted a better way. And, since I no longer have the distraction
        of New Orleans food and nightlife and I might be mildly obsessive when I have projects in
        mind, this is my attempt at a better way of remembering meals.
        \n
        \nThis program is a whole hearted effort to solve an admittedly first world problem and
        get a chance to learn some new skills along the way. I am not a programmer by education or
        occupation, but I have used this app as a proving ground to learn. I have attempted to make
        a solid, usable product that I can build and improve on in future versions. Although I have
        tested it for stability and usability concerns, there is a chance you might find a few bugs
        and glitches here and there. Please, let me know what you see and I\'ll do my best to
        correct them. Along with this, I will be updating and improving the user interface to make
        it as efficient as possible. And hopefully prettier, too.
        \n
        \nNow that I have this tool that I wanted, I no longer live in New Orleans and I try to
        spend some money on things other than restaurants, things like new clothes and actual
        furniture. Even though I may be missing a few meals from my journal, I
        hope it\'s something you find useful.
        \n
        \nPlease let me know your thoughts, questions, comments, or complaints.

    <string name="dialog_help_header">How to track a Memory Bite</string>
    <string name="dialog_help_body">Memory Bite is a quick, lightweight food journal which tracks
        photos and notes of different meals, lets you quickly flip through your previous meals, and
        share with friends and family. It is intended to be fast and unobtrusive so that you can
        make entries without interrupting your meal.
        \n
        \nNow get started!
